## Kyle's Mac Configurations

Some code I use to setup new laptops. 

## Apache / DNSMasq

Map `.mac` to `127.0.0.1`, then configure `/Sites` so you can add `newsite.mac` and access it at `http://newsite.mac` instantly, without Apache/Hostsfile edits

## Dock

Put spaces in Dock and then lock it so it can't get dragged around and your icons don't get accidently removed
